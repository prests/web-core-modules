# Files and directories to exclude from Prettier formatting
# Add patterns here to prevent Prettier from formatting specific files
#
# NOTE: Prettier automatically respects .gitignore patterns, so consider
# adding files to .gitignore instead if they should be ignored by both
# Git and Prettier. Only add patterns here for files that are tracked
# by Git but should not be formatted by Prettier.
